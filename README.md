# Honeycomb Cell System (HCS)

> **Structure = Computation = Communication**

The Honeycomb Cell System (HCS) is a distributed computational architecture based on a hexagonal lattice topology. It unifies data representation, execution environments, and communication pathways into a single, scalable, fractal structure.

Designed by **Raj Mitra**.

## 🧬 Core Vision

HCS represents a shift from centralized control to emergent computation. By arranging autonomous cells in a hexagonal grid, computational power scales through spatial expansion rather than architectural redesign.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is defined by several key layers:
- **Layer 1: HDA Encoding** – Serialized representation of cell structure and connectivity.
- **Layer 2: Structural Graph** – The mapping of neighbor relationships.
- **Layer 11: Runtime Architecture** – The engine capable of parsing and executing HCS graphs.

For a deep dive into the theoretical framework, mathematical model, and execution cycle, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🚀 Live Demo

A reference implementation of the **HDA (Honeycomb Data Architecture)** container protocol is available in the `demo/` folder.

This demo showcases a self-aware archive container that uses **Parallel Scaling**, **AES-256-GCM Encryption**, and **Deflate Compression** to forge payloads directly in the browser.

## 🛡️ Principles

1. **Locality:** Cells operate using only local information.
2. **Emergent Computation:** Global behavior arises from repeated local transformations.
3. **Structural Execution:** Topology defines the execution pathways.
4. **Distributed State:** No central control; the state is the system.
