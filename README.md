## 1. Overview

HCS is a topology-driven distributed computation paradigm. It is based on the principle that the physical and logical structure of a system should directly determine its computational behavior and communication pathways.

By utilizing a **Hexagonal Lattice Topology**, HCS achieves:
- **Maximum Spatial Efficiency:** Every cell has exactly 6 neighbors at equal distance.
- **Decentralized Emergence:** Global logic emerges from local cell-to-cell interactions.
- **Unified Protocol:** Data representation, execution environment, and network routing are collapsed into a single structural layer.

## 2. The Modular Kingdom

HCS serves as the foundational architecture for a larger ecosystem of research projects:

### 🌐 [PDPF (Programmable Dynamic Pattern Format)](https://github.com/Sansmatic-z/PDPF)
A rule-based generative media format designed for AI training and temporal research. It implements the **Supernova Training Curriculum**.

### 🧠 [LIVINGPATTERN](https://github.com/Sansmatic-z/LIVINGPATTERN)
A self-training neural system that learns from chaotic pattern dynamics without external supervision.

## 3. Core Principles

1.  **Locality:** Cells only interact with their immediate 6 neighbors. There is no central controller.
2.  **Fractal Scaling:** The hexagonal pattern is recursive; a group of 7 cells can form a "Super-Cell" following the same rules.
3.  **Surprise-Driven Learning:** The system evolves by minimizing the gap between predicted and actual structural states.
